### Installing Nuxt UI v3

LandiNuxt depends on Nuxt UI v3. Follow the setup instructions on the [Nuxt UI v3 official website](https://ui3.nuxt.dev/getting-started/installation).

## Nuxt UI v3 Configuration

Nuxt UI v3 includes pre-configured settings for **Color Mode**, **Fonts**, and **TailwindCSS**. We recommend keeping these default configurations, as our components are optimized to work with them.

### Font Configuration

Currently, our components use the following font families:

```css
--font-family-inter: "Inter", sans-serif;
--font-family-lora: "Lora", serif;
--font-family-instrument: "Instrument Serif", serif;
--font-family-roboto: "Roboto", sans-serif;
```

For more details on theming, visit the [Nuxt UI Theme Guide](https://ui3.nuxt.dev/getting-started/theme).

## Additional Required Modules

In addition to Nuxt UI v3, you’ll need the following modules for full component functionality:

- **Nuxt Image**: [Installation Instructions](https://image.nuxt.com/get-started/installation)
